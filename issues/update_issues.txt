When a record gets imported into Jira the Extrnal ID is set to the Jira Ticket ID's short name.
This prevents it from getting imported to Jira a second time.

Setting the External ID of an issue previously imported into Jira back to an empty string should allow it to be imported again.

Filtered on specific ExternalID. Generally you would want to cast a wider net.
